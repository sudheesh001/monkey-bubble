* Released libgnome 1.100.0 "Nature One".

  This is the first library freeze release of libgnome.

  The following files are API frozen for GNOME 2.0:

        libgnome/gnome-program.[ch]
        libgnome/gnome-init.[ch]
        libgnome/gnome-preferences.[ch]
        libgnome/gnome-i18n.h (*)

     (*) I need to add one or two new functions to this file.

  The following files are semi-API frozen for GNOME 2.0,
  but have outstanding issues:

        libgnome/gnome-exec.[ch] (**)
        libgnome/gnome-sound.[ch] (***)
        libgnome/gnome-triggers.[ch] (***)

     (**) Need to have a look at the API, but should be ok.

     (***) Should basically be ok.

  The following files are NOT API frozen:

        libgnome/gnome-url.[ch] - someone needs to find out what
            to do with it.

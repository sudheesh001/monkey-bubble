August 28, 2001:
===============

* Bumped version number to 1.103.0 so people can depend on a clean version.
  The next release will be libgnome 1.104.0 "Going back to Roswell".

  - bug fixes (George).

  - idl/Gnome.idl:

      * removed GNOME::SelectionMode - this was only used internally, so it's better
        not to have this in the core libraries.

      * added GNOME::ExtraAttributes as alias for Bonobo::PropertySet.

      * added GNOME::Encoding.

August 11, 2001:
===============

* Released libgnome 1.102.0 "Roswell".

  - a few bug fixes.

  Outstanding API issues:

     None

August 9, 2001:
==============

* Released libgnome 1.101.0 "Pearl Harbor".

  - after a discussion & release meeting, removed all the sound stuff.

  - added back gnome_*_file and gnome_unconditional_*_file for
    convenience, #defines them as gnome_program_locate_file() calls.

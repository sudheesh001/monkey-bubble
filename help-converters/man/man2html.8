.\" man2html - UNIX Man Page to HTML translator
.TH man2html 8 "3 May 1996" "Michael Hamilton" "Linux"
.SH NAME
man2html \- UNIX Man Page to HTML translator
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBman2html\fP [options] [pagespec] 
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBMan2html\fP is a UNIX Man Page to HTML translator that can be
used as a CGI interface for man page access via httpd daemons.

This man2html is more formally called \fBVH-Man2html\fP - Richard 
Verhoeven's Man2html modified and packaged by Michael Hamilton.

.B Man2html
can be used to view man pages using your web browser.
.B Man2html 
locates compressed or uncompressed man pages
anywhere in the normal man hierarchy.
It translates pages in both the man(7) and 
.I mandoc 
(BSD) macro styles.  
It generates html directly from  troff(1) and tbl(1)
macro source without the need for 
tbl/troff/nroff (sorry eqn isn't supported).  
It generates links to other man pages, C include files, include files,
and http references.
Supporting CGI scripts allow you to browse HTML  whatis(1)
subject indexes and name-only indexes.
You can optionally add glimpse(1)
(a text indexing package) to do full text searches.
.PP
There are five ways of requesting pages:

.TP
.I "\fBman2html"
Invoking \fBman2html\fP without parameters causes the starting page
to be presented.  You can use the search-able index on the starting
page to enter requests corresponding to following requests.
.PP
.TP
.I "\fBman2html \ \fIpage_name\fP"
Invoking \fBman2html\fP with a \fIpage_name\fP" as a parameter will
cause it to search for pages that match the name.  If more than one
page is located, HTML for selecting any of the pages will be generated.
If a single page is located, a redirect for full path name will
be generated - which effectively re-invokes man2html with the full
reference.
.PP
.TP
.I "\fBman2html \ \fIpage_name \ \fIsection_number\fP"
Similar to the above, but the required section is supplied to limit
the search.
.TP
.I "\fBman2html \-M \ \fP/\fIman_hierarchy_toplevel \ \fIpage_name \fP"
Similar to the above but the search is started in a particular
man page hierarchy, for example /usr/local/man.
.PP
.TP
.I "\fBman2html \ \fP/\fIfull_path_to_page_name\fB.\fIsection_number \fP"
The specified man page is translated.  The page may optionally be
compressed with any of the compess utilities defined in /etc/man.config.
.SH BROWSING 
To use these cgi scripts from a Web browser all you have to do is
point your web browser at
.nf
        http://localhost/cgi-bin/man2html 
.fi
You can either save this location as a bookmark or use an editor to
insert the following lines into an appropriate place in
a top level document.
.nf
   <H3><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man2html">Linux Manual Pages</A></H3>
.fi
The netscape-man(1) script allows you to enter man page requests at
the command line with the output presented in Netscape.  If you are
already running netscape, the script will pass the request to the
existing browser.  You can can use your shell to alias the name to
something shorter if you wish.

.B Man2html 
has been tested with netscape(1) version 2.0 (I recommend Helvetica
fonts) and with lynx(1) (lynx can't do tables).  Output for a large
number of pages has been verified with weblint(1).
.B Man2html 
has also been tested as a server to other UNIX hosts.
.SH INSTALLATION
For some of the indexes to work you must generate the necessary
databases.

The manwhatis CGI script uses the /usr/man/whatis (see whatis(1)) file
to build a man page index.  If this job has never been run (perhaps
because you turn your machine off at night when cron might be
scheduled to run it), you can build it by becoming the root user and
entering:
.nf
   /usr/sbin/makewhatis /usr/man /usr/X11R6/man /usr/local/man
.fi
WARNING: makewhatis on my Caldera 1.0 takes about 30 minutes on my
486DX66.  I have a modified version of makewhatis so that it does
exactly the same job in only 1.5 minutes. My modified version is now
available as part of man-1.4g.tar.gz:
.nf
   ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/Manual-pagers
.fi
To use the Glimpse full text searching, you will need to install
glimpse in /usr/bin.  
The glimpse home ftp site is 
.nf
   ftp://ftp.cs.arizona.edu/glimpse/
.fi
Redhat rpm users can get glimpse from 
.nf
   ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/non-free/glimpse-3.0-1.i386.rpm
.fi
N.B. glimpse is not freely redistributable for commercial use.  
Having installed glimpse, 
you will need to
build a glimpse index in /var/man2html.  This doesn't take too long -
about 3 minutes on my 486DX2/66 16MB machine.  As root do:
.nf
  /usr/bin/glimpseindex -z -H /var/man2html /usr/man/man* /usr/X11R6/man/man* \
      /usr/local/man/man* /opt/man/man*
  chmod ugo+r /var/man2html/.glimpse*
.fi
The -z option causes glimpse to apply any filters (for decompression etc)
specified in /var/man2html/.glimpse_filters.
This could be set up as a cron job in /etc/crontab, e.g. (the following
must be all on one line):
.nf
   21 04 * * 1 root /usr/bin/glimpseindex -H /var/man2html /usr/man/man* 
       /usr/X11R6/man/man* /usr/local/man/man* /opt/man/man* ;
       chmod +r /var/man2html/.glimpse*
.fi
To serve man pages to remote hosts, all that is required is a httpd 
daemon that sets the environment variable SERVER_NAME correctly.
The only problem you might have with this, is if your server machine
has dual-names.
.SH SECURITY

I've modified Richard's man2html C code so that it checks all client
input parameters.  It checks both for length and any characters that
need escaping.

Man2html will only return man or mandoc files resident in the man
hierarchy defined in /etc/man.config.  When it returns references to
any any other kinds of files, for example, include files, they will be
"file:" references on the CLIENT host, not on the server.

The parameters to the decompression programs are checked for any
nasties.

It is still possible for the contents of a man page to over-run
man2html's memory - so I guess a hacker might try to get you to
install a bogus man page in order to get man2html to do something
nasty.

The scripts check their parameters for anything suspicious.

The scripts and program write suspicious requests to stderr - so they
can be found in web server log files.

Monkey Bubble 0.4.0
===================

Monkey Bubble 0.4.0 is the long-awaited new release of the Bust'a'Move clone
for Gnome. It is packed with several new features and makes even more fun.

### Drastic Changes:
 * the sound system got ported to use GStreamer 0.10 (and this is the first
   release making sound on my computer)

### Significant Changes:
 * monkey bubble doesn't cause a CPU load of 100% anymore

### Technical Changes:
 * translations are managed with the gnome-doc-utils now (so translating the
   documentation is really easy)
 * libegg got removed (we're now using the GTK+ 2.10 code for the functions)
 * compile with gcc 3.4, 4.0 and 4.1
